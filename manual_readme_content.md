Dry Run parameter when enabled, checks whether the user has the required permissions for the action,
without actually making the request, and provides an error response in every scenario. If the user
has the required permissions, the error response is **DryRunOperation** , otherwise, it is
**UnauthorizedOperation.**

## Asset Configuration

There are two ways to configure an AWS EC2 asset. The first is to configure the **access_key** ,
**secret_key** and **region** variables. If it is preferred to use a role and Phantom is running as
an EC2 instance, the **use_role** check box can be checked instead. This will allow the role that is
attached to the instance to be used. Please see the [AWS EC2 and IAM
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html)
for more information. Note that checking the **use_role** check box in the asset configuration will
*override* the access and secret keys if they are already set.

## Assumed Role Credentials

The optional **credentials** action parameter consists of temporary **assumed role** credentials
that will be used to perform the action instead of those that are configured in the **asset** . The
parameter is not designed to be configured manually, but should be used in conjunction with the
Phantom AWS Security Token Service app. The output of the **assume_role** action of the STS app with
data path **assume_role\_\<number>:action_result.data.\*.Credentials** consists of a dictionary
containing the **AccessKeyId** , **SecretAccessKey** , **SessionToken** and **Expiration** key/value
pairs. This dictionary can be passed directly into the credentials parameter in any of the following
actions within a playbook. For more information, please see the [AWS Identity and Access Management
documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/index.html) .
