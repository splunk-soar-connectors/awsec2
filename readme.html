Dry Run parameter when enabled, checks whether the user has the required permissions for the action, without actually making the request, and provides an error response in every scenario. If the user has the required permissions, the error response is <b>DryRunOperation</b>, otherwise, it is <b>UnauthorizedOperation.</b>

<h2>Asset Configuration</h2>
There are two ways to configure an AWS EC2 asset.  The first is to configure the <b>access_key</b>, <b>secret_key</b> and <b>region</b> variables.  If it is preferred to use a role and Phantom is running as an EC2 instance, the <b>use_role</b> check box can be checked instead.  This will allow the role that is attached to the instance to be used.  Please see the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html">AWS EC2 and IAM documentation</a> for more information.  Note that checking the <b>use_role</b> check box in the asset configuration will <i>override</i> the access and secret keys if they are already set.

<h2>Assumed Role Credentials</h2>
The optional <b>credentials</b> action parameter consists of temporary <b>assumed role</b> credentials that will be used to perform the action instead of those that are configured in the <b>asset</b>.  The parameter is not designed to be configured manually, but should be used in conjunction with the Phantom AWS Security Token Service app.  The output of the <b>assume_role</b> action of the STS app with data path <b>assume_role_&lt;number&gt;:action_result.data.*.Credentials</b> consists of a dictionary containing the <b>AccessKeyId</b>, <b>SecretAccessKey</b>, <b>SessionToken</b> and <b>Expiration</b> key/value pairs.  This dictionary can be passed directly into the credentials parameter in any of the following actions within a playbook.  For more information, please see the <a href=https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iam/index.html>AWS Identity and Access Management documentation</a>.
